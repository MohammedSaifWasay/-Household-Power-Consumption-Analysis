# 🔌 Household Power Consumption Analysis

This project explores over 2 million records of household electricity consumption using machine learning and data mining techniques. The goal is to identify patterns, classify usage, and uncover energy inefficiencies to guide sustainable practices and smart energy usage.

## 🧠 Objectives

- Classify electricity usage into Peak/Off-Peak periods.
- Identify anomalies and potential appliance malfunctions.
- Cluster households based on usage patterns.
- Generate appliance usage rules through association mining.

## 🛠️ Techniques Used

- **Data Preprocessing**: Outlier treatment, imputation, normalization  
- **Visualization**: Time-series plots, boxplots, scatter plots, heatmaps  
- **Modeling**:
  - Decision Tree
  - K-Means Clustering (5 and 6 clusters)
  - SVM (Support Vector Machine)
  - Multinomial Logistic Regression
  - Association Rule Mining (Apriori Algorithm)

## 📈 Key Insights

- **Peak Usage**: Morning (~10 AM) and Evening (~7 PM)
- **Sub-Metering 3**: Highest usage, linked to water heaters/AC
- **K-Means Clustering**: 6 clusters offered more granular household segmentation
- **SVM**: Identified appliance malfunctions with high accuracy
- **Logistic Regression**: Classified households into high/medium/low consumption with 99.6% accuracy
- **Apriori Rules**: High correlation between kitchen and heating appliance usage

## 🔍 Recommendations

- Promote smart thermostats and energy-efficient appliances
- Encourage off-peak usage for high-load appliances
- Deploy smart meters for real-time monitoring
- Tailor energy-saving campaigns to clustered household profiles
